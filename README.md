# Everis Machine Learning Prize
This repository contains our project for the Everis Machine Learning Prize competition. This project was developed by [Jo√£o Figueira](https://github.com/joaoperfig) and [Tiago Almeida](https://github.com/ForbiddenOne).

The objective was to create a dataset and train a neural network that could indentify multiple (possibly different) fruits in images.

We implemented two different solutions. The first one use uses a YOLO model trained with the Microsoft COCO library. This library only contains 3 classes of fruits (Apples, Bananas and Oranges). Results are show in the images below (more examples can be found in the folder [results](https://github.com/joaoperfig/everismlprize/tree/master/Results/YOLO)).

The second approach is a convolutional neural network created by us and trained using our own dataset to be able to identify a broader variety of fruits. The images below show the achieved results with our model (more examples can be found in the folder [results](https://github.com/joaoperfig/everismlprize/blob/master/Results/Our%20NN)).
